Despite relatively low levels of belief in each concept , a majority of the Czech public ( 65 % ) believes in at least one of the nine concepts included in the survey ( belief in God plus the eight items in the accompanying chart ) . Even among religiously unaffiliated Czechs , 52 % believe in at least one of the concepts , including about a third ( 32 % ) who believe in fate ( i.e. , that the course of one \u2019s life is largely or wholly preordained ) . And Czechs overall are much more likely to believe in the existence of the soul and fate than they are to believe in God .", "qas": [{"question": "Compare the rate of people who believe in hell in countries of the Central and Eastern Europe?", "is_impossible": false, "id": "2019", "answers": [{"answer_start": 326, "text": "19 % of Czechs believe in hell , compared with a regional median of 54 %"}]}]}]}]}
